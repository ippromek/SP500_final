### Calculate confidence interval for S&P500 dataset using Apache Spark.

**Assignment description:**
The Standard & Poor's 500, often abbreviated as the S&P 500, is an American stock market index representing the performance of the overall stock market in the US.
In this Assignment, the change of S&P 500 is defined as the percentage of index change compared to the previous closing index. For example, yesterday’s S&P 500 is at 1000 when stock closed; today’s S&P 500 is at 1002 when stock closed; in this case, the change of S&P 500 today is 2%.
You are required to write a Spark application in Java or Scala to find out a range [-x%, x%], so that the probability of “the change of S&P falls in this range” is around 90% statistically. For example, if 90% of the S&P change falls in the range of [-5%, 5%], your application should output 5% as the result.
